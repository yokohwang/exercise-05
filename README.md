## Structural HTML


### Objectives

- Organize content using structural HTML tags


### Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking "Clone or Download". Select "Download ZIP".

Included in the `exercise-04` (or `exercise-04-master`) directory are the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- 300.png
- 400.png
- 600.png
- article.html
- index.html
- style.css

Do not move any files outside of this directory.

Add new files to the `exercise-04` directory.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**



### Tasks

DO NOT add the style sheet until the very end. (If I catch any pairs using the style sheet to complete the exercise, I will make you start over.)

Begin this exercise with `index.html`.

1. Validate the HTML. Are there any mistakes before you begin?  Make sure nothing is broken when running the code through a validator and viewing it in the browser.

2. Identify the information at hand. **Before you touch the code**, either print a copy of the web page or draw your own template as to how the HTML/content should be grouped into different structural components.

  There are a couple ways you might approach this. Consider if there are multiple options. Is there a reason one option might be better than another?

3. When you have finished adding HTML5 structural tags, validate your code again to verify you have not introduced any errors.

4. Add the following line to the `<head>` of your document:

  ```html
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

  If your page has been structured properly, you should see the structural components boxed and highlighted in different grays. In some cases, you will see boxes within boxes.

5. Repeat the steps above with `article.html`.

  `index.html` and `article.html` do share some similar components (as they are pages on the same web site). Can you re-use the organization pattern you established in `index.html` on `article.html`?


### How to tackle this project

**Read the task.**

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down the task to be completed. When you finish, check it off.

Decide on the next task to tackle.

It is okay if you get stuck. Set aside the task giving you trouble, decide on another and move on. Be sure you have written down the task giving you trouble (so you can spend time on it later).


### Am I done?

It is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you *are* finished, delete your work and code it again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.


### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

  - Did I forget to close a tag?
  - Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
  - Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
  - Are my file names, directory paths correct?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
